# OctoAcme Project Management Processes

Welcome! 👋

This documentation hub provides a comprehensive guide to OctoAcme's project management processes and practices. Whether you're a new team member looking to understand how we work or an experienced contributor seeking reference materials, you'll find everything you need here.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to streamline cross-functional product delivery by providing clear guidance, consistent workflows, and well-defined roles for all team members. Our approach emphasizes:

- **Clear ownership and collaboration** across all project phases
- **Transparent communication** through structured meetings and standardized templates
- **Quality assurance** integrated throughout the development lifecycle
- **Continuous improvement** via regular retrospectives and actionable feedback

## Project Lifecycle

At a high level, the lifecycle is broken into several phases—**initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective**—each with its own goals, checklists, and required documentation:

1. **Initiation**: New projects start by clarifying the problem, defining success metrics and stakeholders, and producing key artifacts such as a one-pager and project board skeleton.

2. **Planning**: Detailed backlog creation, estimates, dependencies, and risk management strategies captured in a risk register.

3. **Execution**: Active development with daily standups, code reviews, and continuous testing.

4. **Release & Deployment**: Standardized release checklists, automated testing, security scanning, and deployment validation.

5. **Retrospective**: Structured reflection to promote continuous improvement, tracking action items and celebrating incremental wins.

## Roles & Personas

Each project has clearly defined roles to ensure accountability and effective collaboration:

- **[Project Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#project-managers)**: Handles delivery coordination, schedules, risk management, and communications.
- **[Product Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#product-managers)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes work, and measures success.
- **[Developers](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#developers)**: Implement features, create and maintain tests, participate in code reviews, and contribute to technical documentation.
- **[QA Lead](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#qa-lead)**: Define test strategies and ensure quality gates are met throughout the development lifecycle.
- **[Release Manager](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#release-manager)**: Coordinate release planning, schedules, and deployment activities.
- **[DevOps Engineer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#devops-engineer)**: Manage infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and deployment automation.
- **[UX Designer](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#ux-designer)**: Research user needs, design interfaces, and ensure excellent user experiences.
- **[Stakeholder](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md#stakeholder-customeruser-champion)**: Represent customer interests, validate solutions, and provide business context.

These roles are supported by checklists, templates, and a focus on sharing knowledge within the team, which accelerates onboarding and reduces dependency on any single individual.

## Communication Strategies

Communication is structured for transparency and effective decision-making:

- **Daily Standups**: Brief sync-ups to share progress, blockers, and plans
- **Weekly Syncs**: PM and Product Manager alignment meetings
- **Regular Demos**: Showcase completed work to stakeholders
- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates**: Keep leadership and stakeholders informed
- **Retrospectives**: Structured team reflection on what went well and what can improve

Status updates, risk escalations, and incident reports are shared using standardized templates to ensure everyone remains aligned. Incident and risk escalation paths are clearly documented so that issues are quickly addressed at the right level.

## Quality Assurance

Quality is integrated throughout our process with a strong emphasis on:

- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and smoke tests as part of continuous integration
- **Continuous Integration Pipelines**: Automated builds and tests on every commit
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning before releases
- **Manual QA**: Acceptance testing performed as needed
- **Standardized Release Checklists**: Ensuring consistency and reducing errors
- **Code Reviews**: Peer review for all code changes

Collectively, these practices foster reliability, maintainability, and a responsive team culture at OctoAcme.
